						My education has allowed me to have a comprehensive understanding of the interdisciplinary
						avenues in the field of Neuroscience, as well as its intersection with the broad field of
						Computer Science. I have had the opportunity to combine the two in my study of computational
						neuroscience and neural network modeling of learning behaviors. Additionally, I have learned
						fundamental concepts and in Computer Science in my programming and software development courses.
